"""Verify the two dumbbell rules that live in a formula rather than in a drawing.

Both rules in `references/type-bar.md` are formula-level: a generator implements
them arithmetically, and both fail in ways that render perfectly. Prose alone
cannot defend either, so both are executable here and the reference is checked
against this module rather than the other way round.

1. DOMAIN RESOLUTION - the axis bounds are a function of the data's range, never
   of its observed extremes. Taking `min`/`max` as the bounds IS the truncation
   the reference forbids: the plot width is fixed, so a narrowed domain raises
   px-per-unit and draws every gap wider. The subtle case is zero. A sign-based
   rule that says "all-positive" and "all-negative" silently omits data that
   only touches zero, and omits the all-zero dataset entirely - where the naive
   reading yields `floor == ceil == 0` and the position formula divides by zero.
   `resolve_domain` partitions the space exhaustively and guarantees
   `ceil > floor`, so coordinates are always finite.

2. NON-TEXT CONTRAST - the solid endpoint and the connector are the marks that
   carry "which series" and "which pair". WCAG 1.4.11 asks 3:1 of a graphical
   object required to understand the content, and shape redundancy does not
   waive it: a reader still has to see the solid mark's boundary and the line
   joining the pair. Accent-on-paper is 2.86:1 skin-wide and cannot carry that,
   so the boundary is carried by a stroke and the connector by an alpha that
   clears 3:1 in both themes. The thresholds are checked here against the tokens
   the reference actually documents, so the two cannot drift apart.

The check FAILS CLOSED. A reference this cannot parse, or a token it cannot
find, is a finding - never a silent pass.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/verify-dumbbell.py
    python3 scripts/verify-dumbbell.py --reference path/to/type-bar.md

Exit: 0 clean, 1 findings, 2 usage.
