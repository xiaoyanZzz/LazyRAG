"""Verify that a slopegraph's drawn slopes match the values it prints.

A slopegraph makes exactly one claim: **both axes carry the same scale**, so the
angle of a line is a rate of change and two angles are comparable. Break that
claim and nothing errors - the figure renders, every label is present, and the
lie is in the geometry. `lint-skin.py` reads colors and fonts, `verify-geometry.py`
reads label masks against later-painted nodes, and neither compares a drawn
endpoint against the number sitting beside it.

Six invariants, each of which has shipped broken in a draft of this type:

1. SHARED SCALE - the left and right axes must map value to y through the same
   linear transform. Both halves are checked, slope *and* origin: a second axis
   that is rescaled makes every slope wrong by a factor, and one that is merely
   shifted makes every slope wrong by a constant. Checking the slope alone would
   pass the shifted case, which is the easier mistake to make.

2. NO JITTER - each declared value must sit where the shared scale puts it. The
   draft this checker was written against nudged two series apart by 3px because
   their labels collided at identical values; both then read as different
   numbers. Crowded endpoint labels are data, not a coordinate problem.

3. UNTRANSFORMED GEOMETRY - the coordinates read here are raw attributes, so any
   `transform` on verified geometry, on its labels, or on an ancestor moves the
   rendered mark away from the number this checker validated. A single
   `transform="translate(0 80)"` on one series line slid its endpoint 80px and
   every check still passed. Transforms are rejected rather than resolved: a
   partial implementation of the SVG transform stack is worse than an honest
   refusal, because it looks like coverage.

4. COMPLETE PRINTED VALUES - the whole visible numeric token must match the
   declared one. Matching only the first fragment read the label "512,000" as
   512 and agreed with metadata that said 512.

5. LABELS BOUND TO MEANING - state captions belong to a named axis, and each
   series name belongs to a series and an end. Unbound, the two captions can be
   swapped - reversing the reading of the entire figure - or two names exchanged
   between rows, with every geometric check still green.

6. FAIL CLOSED - a file that presents as a slopegraph but yields nothing
   parseable is a finding, never a pass. A checker that reports OK because it
   found nothing to compare is the bug, not the gate. `verify-treemap.py`
   returned early on `len(cells) < 3` and that is precisely how an undersized
   cell went unverified.

The basis for geometry is the `data-from` / `data-to` pair each series line
declares, never the rendered text. Deriving the basis from text is what let a
treemap cell with no label drop silently out of the checked set; here a series
whose label is missing or restyled stays in the set and its missing label is
itself reported.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT CHECK, deliberately:

- **Direction.** An axis whose y grows with value is accepted. That is correct
  for a rank slopegraph, where rank 1 belongs at the top, and this checker has no
  way to tell an intended inversion from a mistaken one.
- **Absolute truth.** Every check here is internal consistency. If every label
  and every declared value is wrong by the same constant, the figure is
  self-consistent and passes; nothing in the file could reveal otherwise. The
  source line is where the domain is stated to a reader, and prose is not parsed.
- **Curvature below tolerance.** A value-to-y map that bends by less than
  RESIDUAL_TOLERANCE at every point is indistinguishable from a straight one.
